WakeCup

Welcome to your capstone project where you will work on a realistic case and create a complete website for a fictitious organization. In doing so, you will not only get a taste of major HTML5 and CSS3 features, but it will also put to test your creative abilities as you work with text and image content and a sitemap to create and deliver a production worthy website.
 
Problem Statement
Design a responsive website for a boutique coffee company named WakeCup. Use the provided content and assets and feel free to creatively improvise beyond the design brief. 
 
Design Brief
WakeCup is a boutique coffee company based in Seattle and specializes in unique coffee blends from hand-picked coffee plantations from around the world. WakeCup offers a range of coffee powders, brewing equipment and has a handful of cafeterias where one can enjoy coffee over great conversation and ambience. The company, which started in 2006 has had a terrible website and wants to start afresh to gain traction in the venture capital market as they’re keen on expanding their presence and crossing borders to other countries in Americas and Europe and perhaps later, the world. 
 
A good website is the first step. Your job is to understand the sitemap and the provided content to create a responsive website which showcases coffee blends, equipment and other things in an impressive manner.

IMPORTANT
Before you begin: We’ve organized all content, assets and specifications in an archive that you can download from this link: 
https://kh3-ls-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/HTML/Assets%26Specifications_ForCapstone.zip 
Please have this handy, before proceeding with the instructions below.
 
NOTE: In addition to the assets, please see Important Notes and the Specifications section for generic wireframes which may be used as a very rough guide. We invite your creativity to play a major role in the production of this website and the wireframes are nothing more than a gentle suggestion.
 
 
 
The Homepage
The homepage should not only be visually inviting, it should also provide access to other sections of the website and highlight key elements of the business by use of images. Besides the creative use of images, the homepage should include the following body copy:
 
“WakeCup isn’t just a call to rise and win, it is our mission to tap into the finest plantations and estates for the greatest coffee that our planet produces. Whether it’s a steaming mug of straight up cappuccino, a tumbler of flavoursome Indian filter kaapi, or a tall glass of vanilla matcha latte - we’ve got the blend that puts the zing in your step and the life in your day!
 
WakeCup with us!”
 
The page, like every page should have a common navigation bar with the logo (see included images). The contents of the navigation bar are described below. Elsewhere on the page, use images to link up to Our Cafes and The Source
 
Common Navigation Bar
A navigation bar should appear on all pages and should carry the following links:

About Us
This page should be creatively dressed with images and it should carry the body copy as provided in the Asset/AboutUs folder. 
 
Coffee Blends
This page should carry a catalogue of coffee blends available at WakeCup. Please see the Coffee Blends document for the content. Display the blends in a grid over the course of two pages, one each for the two blends that WakeCup offers. See the content in the Assets/CoffeeBlends folder
 
Brewing Equipment
This page should be roughly like the Coffee Blends page with images of brewing equipment as listed in the sitemap and a buy button against them. The button shouldn’t link to anything. See the Brewing Equipment document in the assets for details. See the content in the Assets/BrewingEquipment folder
 
Learn with us
This page talks about educational initiatives of WakeCup. The company organizes both online and offline workshops to turn ordinary people into expert baristas. See the Workshops document for more details. See the content in the Assets/LearnWithUs folder

This page should have the following body text and address cards for three locations:

Metro Market, Milwaukee
Williamsport, Pennsylvania
 
The Source
This page carries details of the coffee estates and plantations from where WakeCup sources its beans. See the content in the Assets/TheSource folder. 
 
Contact
The contact page should offer a form for individuals to write to the company. The form fields should be as follows:

IMPORTANT NOTES
Please read the notes carefully before beginning work.
The official logo for WakeCup is available in Assets/Logo folder.
Please go through the Assets and improvise accordingly.

The final website should be responsive and compatible with desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
Use royalty/license free images only.
Design and aesthetics are important. Please spend quality time in visualizing the best layout possible before attempting it in code.
The Buy and Signup buttons should not link to anything. Think of it as input to web application developers.
The form should carry the correct input fields.
Optimize images wherever possible. You can use a free online service like PhotoPea for image work.
Besides the provided content, you should improvise, work with the story and add your own content.
Good typography is critical to a successful website.
